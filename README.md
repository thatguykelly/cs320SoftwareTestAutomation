# cs320SoftwareTestAutomation

I can ensure my code, program and software is functional and secure by first debugging anything that is wrong with the base code. Then creating test as I write my code. Since hearing about TDD Ive come to adopt that philosophy as well. If we know what the program needs to do then we can create tests first then build the pseudocode, which Im a fan of, then get to work writing the working code. The requirements will give me the information on what the user needs are. From this I will develop action steps that need to be taken to achieve the requirements. I approach designing software in a slow manner right now. Taking into account what I just mentioned, TDD (Test Driven Development), which is good practice for a developer or engineer to start from. Getting the rquirements from the client I can start the TDD process, then pseudocode then getting into the working code. I just repeated myself.
